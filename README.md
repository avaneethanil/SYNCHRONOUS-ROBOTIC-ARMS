# SYNCHRONOUS ROBOTIC ARMS
 Firmware and UI Code (in Python) for Synchronous Robotic Arms

This is the code for operating two robotic arms synchronously using a UI. The UI consists of three sections of code written in Python while the entire hardware is operated on the Arduino Nano microcontroller. The arduino code for the hardware part is also given along with this file.
